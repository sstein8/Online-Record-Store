Online record shop. Front end built with HTML and CSS. Backend built with Python Flask and MySql database. Hosted online with Amazon ec2.

The website displays records being sold in several categories. A user visiting the web store can search for products (i.e., search for a specific record name and display that record) or display all records in a certain genre. The website also displays the available quantity for each product.

Only a logged in user can add products to a shopping cart and "buy" various quantities of records by checking out. To "buy" a product means to reduce the quantity from that product with the quantity that was "bought" and this is updated in the database.

A logged in user's shopping cart can be viewed, edited, checked out or deleted. A logged in user can also see his/her orders history if there are any.
